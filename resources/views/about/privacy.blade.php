		Fashion Nova Cookie Policy

		This Cookie Policy explains how Fashion Nova, Inc.  (“Fashion Nova”, “we”, “us” or “our”) uses cookies and similar technologies in connection with the www.fashionnova.com website and any other website that we own or control and which posts or links to this Cookie Policy (collectively, the “Sites”), along with the Fashion Nova mobile application and any other mobile applications that we own or control and which posts or links to this Cookie Policy (collectively, the “Apps”).

		What are cookies?

		Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies serve different purposes, like helping us understand how a site is being used, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences and generally improving your browsing experience. 

		Our Sites may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them). 

		We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Sites;  and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers or business partners on our Sites, and can be used by these parties to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.  Third party cookies can be used for a variety of purposes, including site analytics, advertising and social media features.

A SDK is third-party computer code that may be used for a variety of purposes, including to provide us with analytics regarding the use of our mobile applications, to integrate with social media, add features or functionality to our Apps, or to facilitate online advertising.  SDKs may enable third parties to collect information directly via our Apps. 
		Your choices

		Like many companies online, we use services provided by Google, Facebook and others companies that use tracking technology.  Your choices for opting out of these companies’ use of your personal information for interest-based advertising include:

		        European users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising on websites through members of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance by clicking here, selecting the user’s country, and then clicking “Choices” (or similarly titled link).
		        Users of our Apps may opt out of receiving targeted advertising in mobile apps through participating members of the Digital Advertising Alliance by installing the AppChoices mobile app, available here, and selecting the user’s choices.
		        Please note that we also may work with companies that offer their own opt-out mechanisms and may not participate in the opt-out mechanisms that we linked above.

		If you choose to opt-out of targeted advertisements, you will still see advertisements online but they may not be relevant to you.  Even if you do choose to opt out, not all companies that serve online behavioral advertising are included in this list, so you may still receive some cookies and tailored advertisements from companies that are not listed.
